# Sudoku
This program was made to accept a sudoku board, find all the solutions to the board and then print all the boards to a solutions.txt file in the same folder as the executable. To input your sudoku board, go to the main method and locate the declaration of "sudokuGrid" then freely put in the numbers into that array for your board.
